This project implements a food classification model using deep learning techniques. The model is trained to classify images of food into various categories.

It contains the following models:
- **MobileViTv2**: A lightweight model designed for mobile devices, optimized for speed and efficiency.
- **EHFR-Net**: A model that combines Inverted Residual Blocks and LP-ViT for enhanced feature extraction and classification performance in food classification task.
- **AF-Net**: A model that uses the aggregate operation and combines the shuffle module form GS-Net to improve classification accuracy for food classification task.
